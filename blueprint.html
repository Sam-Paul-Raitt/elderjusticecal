			<h2>Blueprint</h2>
			<p>The document represents over two years of exploration and discussions by advocates, service providers, experts in	elder abuse prevention and related fields, and others with an interest	in ensuring justice, safety, and security for older adults in California. These include the findings from the first state summit on elder abuse, held in April of 2010, an environmental scan to gather the collective knowledge about abuse and related topics, and discussions with the leaders of state agencies, professional associations, and advocacy groups.<em> To download the blueprint, click on the image on left.</em></p>
