				<div class='ruler'></div>
				<p>Together with our partners, the California Commission on Aging and the County Welfare Directors Association, and in collaboration with Assemblymember Mariko Yamada, CEJC helped secure a state budget augmentation to support a full-time, dedicated Adult Protective Services (APS) position at the California Department of Social Services to oversee planning and administration of California’s APS program, provide leadership to county programs, coordinate with state and federal agencies, and oversee APS training.</p>
