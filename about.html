			<h2>About the California Elder Justice Coalition</h2>
			<p>The<strong> California Elder Justice Coalition </strong>was created in 2008 to address systemic barriers to elder justice.  In 2010, the group hosted the first state elder justice summit, which brought together 92 experts to explore challenges and solutions.  Recommendations that emerged from the summit as well as focus groups, interviews, and an environmental scan, culminated in  <a href="./docs/Blueprint2011-729-1914.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Improving California's Response to Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation:  A Blueprint.</em></a></p>

			<h4>Our Core Values</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Living free from abuse, neglect, and exploitation is a fundamental right ensured through public policy, access to the legal system, a robust response to abuse, and services that support independence and autonomy.</li>
					<li>Self-determination and autonomy are primary considerations in policy and practice affecting older adults.</li>
					<li>We respect and value diversity and the unique perspectives of the many organizations and disciplines that promote elder justice. Sharing outlooks and resources enriches our field and increases our effectiveness. </li>
					<li>Policy and practice must be based on accurate and non-partisan information to ensure quality and efficiency.</li>
					<li>Broad based participation in policy development by service providers, advocates, educators, students, and researchers is vital to reflect California’s rich diversity and strong traditions of innovation and social justice.</li>
